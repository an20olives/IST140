Scorer (Level 3)
"Scorer" (without the quotation marks) that declares a two-dimensional array of doubles (call it scores) with three rows and three columns and that uses methods and loops as follows.

Use a method containing a nested while loop to get the nine (3 x 3) doubles from the user at the command line.

Use a method containing a nested for loop to compute the average of the doubles in each row.

Use a method to output these three row averages to the command line.

Get a String from the user at the command line
Populate an ArrayList of Character data (the wrapper class), with each char in the String represented as a separate Character element in the ArrayList
